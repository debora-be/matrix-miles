# MatrixMiles: Advanced Navigation for Martian Vehicles

## Overview

MatrixMiles provides a reliable navigation simulation platform, meticulously designed for vehicles navigating the Martian terrain. The system ensures safe and accurate travel from points like Olympus Mons to Valles Marineris. While terrestrial vehicles may rely on GPS, vehicles on Mars can trust MatrixMiles for their journeying needs.

## Features

**Matrix Navigation**: Navigate Mars with precision, following a clear matrix-based system.
**Boundary Enforcement**: Our system ensures vehicles remain within the set terrain, preventing potential mishaps.
**Language Support**: MatrixMiles is adaptable to both English and Portuguese navigation commands.
**Docker Integration**: Utilize our dockerized environment for smooth deployment and running of the application.
**Auto-Startup**: The application initializes automatically upon the start of the Docker container.

## Setup and Running

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone and Navigate to Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:debora-be/matrix-miles.git
   cd matrix_miles
   ```

2. **Build Using Docker**:

   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm matrix_miles
   ```

Upon startup, simply follow the on-screen instructions to input vehicle positions and navigate the Mars terrain.

## Usage

Once the system is up:

1. Define the terrain matrix (e.g., `5 5`).
2. Specify the number of vehicles.
3. For each vehicle, provide its initial position (e.g., `1 2 N`) and navigation instructions (e.g., `EMEMEMEMM`).

MatrixMiles will then compute and display the final positions of the vehicles based on the provided instructions.

## Testing

To run tests within the Docker environment, use:

```bash
mix test
```

This ensures that the navigation protocols are functioning as expected, safeguarding against potential navigation errors.
